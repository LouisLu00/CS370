## Back-end

## Scraping
The scraping code is stored in: `./Scraping`

- `config.ini`: Stores the configuration parameters for the scraping process, including the URL, page range, and output file name.
- `food_scraper.py`: Contains the scraping methods.
- `recipe.py`: Defines the data structure of the `Recipe` object.
- `file_storage.py`: Serializes the scraped data into a pickle object, which will later be imported into a PostgreSQL database.
