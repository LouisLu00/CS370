Our project goal is to create a user-friendly website that helps users to organize food in their fridges. Also, recommend food recipes according to their previous choice.

## Features
- Virtual Fridge: The virtual fridge allows you to store and organize your ingredients. You can add items through image recognition or manual input, and it records each ingredient's quantity and expiration date. It reminds you when your food is nearing its expiration, helping to reduce waste.
- Automatic Recipe Generation: Our website can automatically generate recipes based on the contents of your virtual fridge. This feature provides you with meal ideas that use the ingredients you already have, making meal planning and cooking more efficient.
- Personalized Recipe Recommendations: Using your past choices, the website offers personalized recipe recommendations. This feature suggests meals that align with your preferences, enhancing your cooking experience with tailored suggestions.
- Image Recognition: Our website leverages AWS Rekognition to allow users to add ingredients to their virtual fridge by taking quick snapshots or uploading images of the ingredients. This image recognition feature makes it quick and easy to upload food data without manual entry, enabling a smoother user experience. It enhances the speed and accuracy of adding ingredients, helping to keep your virtual fridge up-to-date with minimal effort.
- User Registration and Login: Our website offers a seamless registration and login process. Users can create an account to access personalized features like a virtual fridge and tailored recipe recommendations. Our JWT authentication ensures secure user login and registration.
